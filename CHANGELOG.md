### Design Principles
- Optimized for long coding sessions (reduced eye strain)
- Warm Solar Bronze accents prevent harsh blue light exposure
- Hierarchical color distribution (focus → active → secondary → subtle)
- Opacity layering (15%, 50%, 80-90% for different UI states)
- Bioluminescent solarpunk aesthetic

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 Level AAA compliance for primary text (15.5:1)
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for all interactive elements
- Color-blindness considerations (deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia tested)
- Sufficient luminosity differences for all UI states
